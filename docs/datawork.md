# Use DeepSeek V4 with DataWork

DataWork is a **local-first personal AI Agent system for Windows** — your
local context hub and action layer between files, AI conversations, notes,
todos, and other tools.

Every feature is designed for real personal scenarios — helping you
continuously accumulate and reuse context, experience, tools, and workflows.

**What sets DataWork apart:**

- **No registration, no login** — fully offline, fully local. Your data
  stays on your machine.
- **Multi-language UI** (English / Chinese) — designed for both domestic
  and international users.
- **Native Windows desktop app** — clear, intuitive interface.
- **Dual-Agent system** — General Agent (daily chat, info organization) +
  Code Agent (coding, debugging, multi-round tool calls); both share
  model config, memory, todos, plugins, and MCP.
- **MCP ecosystem** — connect external MCP servers, AND expose DataWork's
  own memory and Todo system as an MCP server for Cursor, Claude Desktop,
  Claude Code, and other agent tools to use.
- **Python plugin system** — drop a `.py` file to extend; both Agents can
  call the same plugin immediately.
- **10 AI providers** — DeepSeek, Kimi, Xiaomi MiMo, Qwen, GLM, OpenAI,
  Claude, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama — all in one workspace.
- **Memory + Todo + Notes + Coder + Python + Plugins** — everything
  built in, fully open and extensible, easy to integrate with other agents.
- **Full-featured Code Agent** — Skills, Claw scheduling, Workflows, ACP
  protocol — all built in. When connected to DeepSeek, cache hit rate
  reaches 95%.

DeepSeek V4 models (`deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`) are fully
supported through DataWork's built-in DeepSeek provider, with streaming,
thinking mode, reasoning effort control, and tool calling.

## 1. Install DataWork

- **Repository**: <https://github.com/jkjoker/datawork>
- **Download**: <https://publish.obsidian.md/xm/wiki/%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/datawork%EF%BC%9Aabout>

Download the latest installer (`datawork_setup.exe`), extract if needed,
and run it. DataWork runs on **Windows 10 and above**. No registration or
login required.

## 2. Get a DeepSeek API key

1. Open <https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys>.
2. Sign in and create an API key.
3. Copy your key and keep it private.

## 3. Configure the model

1. Launch DataWork and open **设置 / Settings** → **模型管理 / Model Management**.
2. Fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | `deepseek` |
| Model Name | `deepseek-v4-pro` or `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Base URL | `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions` |
| API Key | Your DeepSeek API key |

When `deepseek` is selected, the Base URL is pre-filled automatically.
Click `添加模型 / Add` to save.

## 4. Create an Agent

1. Open **Settings** → **General Agent** → **Agent Management**.
2. Enter a name, select the DeepSeek model you just added, set permissions,
   and click **Add Agent**.

The Agent is now ready to use in the main AI tab (Expert / Code modes),
in the Coder editor, or via the built-in web server.

In **Expert** mode, select the Agent, choose reasoning depth (`High` / `Max`),
and send a message to start.

## Additional features

DeepSeek V4 integration in DataWork also supports:

- **Thinking mode**: enable via **Tips** → **Conversation Features** →
  **Thinking Mode**.
- **Reasoning effort**: the bottom bar shows `High` / `Max` when the
  model supports it.
- **1M context window**: both V4 models are registered with a 1M-token
  budget.
- **MCP tool calling**: the Agent can call configured tools over multiple
  rounds.
- **Code Agent**: switch to `Code` mode for coding tasks.
